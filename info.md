Hello, 

I am glad that you found your way to our Website. 

A few month ago I started this streamer community on *[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/twitchsquads)* and *[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchsquads)*. It grew from month to month. At some point it was just too much to handle
for one person. Especially when I started the Discord Server to connect everyone. At this point we got 750+ streamers in there, connecting, hosting, streaming together and helping each other to help and grow their audience.
So I needed to get some help. That was the point where I met my Moderators, and later on my SquadGuards to keep the Discord in shape.

My part in the squad is to shout out our streamers and I am in contact with companies (gaming related) publishers and developers to get games, merch and some nice opportunities for our members

You can find and follow us on all social Media, just like *[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/twitchsquads)*, *[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/twitchsquads)* and *[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/twitchsquads)*. And we also got a *[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchsquads)* and a *[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/twitchsquads)* Channel where we show or streamers broadcasts. To follow us use the icons on the mainpage.
